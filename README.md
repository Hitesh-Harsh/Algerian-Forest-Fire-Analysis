**Algerian Forest Fire Analysis and ML Model Optimization**
**Project Overview**
**Objective:**
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of forest fires in Algeria and optimized machine learning models using hyperparameter tuning.

**Data Preprocessing and Transformation**
Transformed data from rows to columns based on specific parameters.
Removed multicollinearity to enhance model performance.
Optimized data types to reduce memory usage and improve processing speed.
Dropped unnecessary columns according to the problem statement.
Corrected spelling errors in the dataset.
Plotted histograms to understand data distribution and identify/remove outliers.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Analyzed fire points across different regions to identify patterns and trends.
Used visualizations to gain insights into the frequency and severity of fires.
